# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

*Purpose*

As a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing company, the first big project is to analyze the rideshare data January to early May of 2019. An easily understood visualization of the results will have to be presented to the company CEO. The analytical work must be both comprehesive and correct to impress the CEO, so the Python graphing libary Matplotlib is used. Based on the results presented, the company will be able to make key decisions about where support and resources are needed based on the different city types. These visualizations will give the CEO a better understanding of affordability of ride-sharing services in underserved communities.

## Results 

*Differences in ride-sharing data amoung different city types*

![Total Fare by City Type (2019)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102566199/167316703-8489c50c-8edb-49da-b8ae-2e99d161e9c2.png)

a. Total Rides

The Urban city type leads the total rides amount with 1,625. This is an expected outcome considering a more highly populated location would have more individuals needing rides. This is also reflected in the Rural city type only having 125 total rides within the time frame. 

b. Total Drivers

There is a huge difference between how many total drivers there are in each city type. There are only 78 drivers in the Rural city type, but this increases for the Surburban and Urban city types. The Surburban city type has 490 drivers and the Urban city type has 2,405 total drivers. 

c. Total Fares

The Urban city type also leads the total fares amount with $39,854.38. This is a huge difference from the Rural city type, which is only $4,327.93. The Urban city type made over 9x more than the Rural city type. 

d. Average Fare per Ride

An interesting relationship is demonstrated between the average fare per ride for each city type. The Rural city type has an average fare of $34.62 per ride, but this gradually drops through the Suburban and Urban city types to $30.97 and $24.53, respectively. 

e. Average Fare per Driver

The same relationship that was demonstrated for the average fare per ride is also evident in the average fare per driver, but it is even more dramatic in this comparison. The average fare per driver in the Rural city type is very high at $55.49, but drops all the way to $16.57 for the Urban city type. 

f. Total Fare by City Type

The final line graph for the total fare by city type allows for the fare amount to be displayed for a four month timeframe in 2019. There are not any true patterns of the lines other than the obvious deduction that the total fares for urban overshadow suburban and rural. There are quite a few spikes in the fare amount throughout the timeframe and it seems to gradually increase through Februrary and March and then continued to slowly peak and decrease till May. 


## Summary 

*Three Business Recommendations*

Based on the data visualization, there are a couple of clear needs that should be addressed by the ride sharing company. The Rural city type is dramatically underserved and lacks the massive amount of drivers that is present in the Urban and Suburban city types. It is unlikely for the rural city type to rely on ride-sharing services, since the average fare per ride is $10 more than what the Urban city type has. 

PyBer should create a hiring initiative to increase the amount of drivers in the rural city type, which would allow for the average fare per ride to decrease. This is a simple case of supply and demand. Once the supply of the drivers increases, the ride per ride would be able to decrease. 

The company could also encourage some of the Urban city type drivers to consider providing rides in the rural city type. Currently, there is too much competition in the Urban city type which means that there are more drivers than total rides given. There must be drivers who are sitting and waiting for rides to be requested, so the company can make use of this through the initiative to go to the rural city types. 

In rural areas, there is more distance between the pick up and drop off locations; therefore, they should decrease the price per mileage to adjust for the deficiency in drivers. This would allow for more riders to use PyBer, as the price wouldn't be so high. Adjusting this would make it more fair to these riders.
